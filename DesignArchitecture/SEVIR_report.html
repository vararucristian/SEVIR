    <h2><span>1. </span>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      SEVIR (semantic-based virtual guide) project is a proposal of Web application that will
      allow clients to use the power of the cartographic Web services in order to augment the
      information about one or more points of interest according to user preferences and
      the current context.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="requirements">
    <h2><span>2. </span>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Use well-known cartographic Web service(s), in conjunction to OpenStreetMap and LinkedGeoData,
      in order to augment the information about one or more points (places) of interest according to
      user preferences (e.g., significant routes, businesses, touristic attractions, nearby locations)
      and context: a specific location, date/time, device, current activity, mood, health status,...
      "Smart" suggestions like orientation clues, map annotations, plus external knowledge could be
      provided by DBpedia and/or Wikidata. Take into consideration the use of proper conceptual models
      regarding the map-related information, car GPS integration, user needs (example: a family having
      small children wants a smooth itinerary including many stops versus a group of youngsters focused
      on fun + (pleasant) surprises), internationalization (i.e., support for automated translation)
      and localization, plus the integration with popular social Web applications – supporting actions
      like sharing and/or accessing photos, videos, reviews, advices, etc. All data managed by the
      developed application will be accessed via a SPARQL endpoint. Additionally, various travel-related
      APIs could be used. Bonus: offer also a conversational Web interface – for instance, integrate
      a chatter bot.

    </figure>
    <p>
      Initial list of use case scenarios:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Register as a new user of the application.</li>
      <li>Authenticate using a username and a password. This action requires registration.</li>
      <li>View a map with multiple interest points based on the real time location of
        the user. This action requires authentication. </li>
      <li>Add/update the user's preferences. This action requires authentication. </li>
      <li>Set a actual context: mood, health status, etc. This action requires authentication.</li>
      <li>Search for suggested places to visit, orientation clues, possible itinerary to o specific
        destination based on the actual parameters set from context and also on the user's preferences.
        This action requires authentication.</li>
      <li>Share or access photos, videos, reviews, advices on/from social media. This action requires
        authentication. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      List of use case scenarios for the functionalities implemented (corresponding to the actual variant of the application):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search for a new place to visit by typing the name/address.</li>
      <li>Set the personal interest points, for example: cultural or sportive attractions, shopping related places, etc.</li>
      <li>Set whether a child will be involved in the trip. (For a smoother journey, with stops not so far from the main route)</li>
      <li>Set the number of hours that you have available in order to visit the place. We will consider that a place can be visited in a medium time of 1 hour.</li>
      <li>View a possible route for visiting the desired place with multiple attractions that the user is interested in and based on the time and availability to deviate from the route. On the map it will also be marked: the actual location of the user, the destination point.</li>
      <li>See details for each of the shown attractions such as: short description, address, image.</li>
      <li>Go back to the search engine.</li>
      <li>Change the language of the application. It is available for romanian and english at the moment.</li>
      <li>Share the experience with Sevir application on social media. </li>
    </ul>

    </figure>
    <p>
      SEVIR will be implemented as a Angular Web Application that will call 4 principal
      services implemented using Java:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accounts service: it will be used as a the users management system. </li>
      <li>Preferences service: it will be responsible for updating and retrieving the information about
        the user preferences.</li>
      <li>Suggestions service: it will be responsible for generating suggestions based on user
        preferences and context. </li>
      <li>Social-Media service: it will be used for sharing/accessing photos, videos, reviews, advices, etc. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The storage for both the Accounts and Preferences services will be provided by a relational database
      (MySQL) and the operation on it will be done via a SPARQL request.
    </p>
    <p>
      For extra information regarding a place we will also use data from DBpedia and Wikidata.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, there will be used 2 external APIs: OpenStreetMap and LinkedGeoData.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>OpenStreetMap will be used by the Angular application and the Suggestions service in order
        to show the map based on the current location, to show the suggestions routes and places. 
        The suggestions will be generated using information about the users.</li>
      <li>LinkedGeoData will be used by the Suggestions service in order to find in a accurate method
        places to visit, orientation clues, possible itinerary to o specific destination based on the
        actual parameters set from context and also on the user's preferences.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section typeof="sa:APIs" id="apis">
    <h2><span>5. </span>APIs</h2>
    <p>
      For each service there will be implemented different requests based on the needs of implementation:
    </p>
      <figure typeOf="sa:image">

        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 3: APIs specification</figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p>
      As an example, for the suggestions service the GET request will be implemented as follows:
    </p>

        <img src="request.jpg" alt="request" width="900">

  <section typeof="sa:ExternalAPIs" id="ExternalAPIs">
    <h2><span>6. </span>External APIs</h2>
    <p>
      <b>LinkedGeoData</b> is an effort to add a spatial dimension to the Web of Data / Semantic Web. LinkedGeoData uses
      the information collected by the OpenStreetMap project and makes it available as an RDF knowledge base according
      to the Linked Data principles. It interlinks this data with other knowledge bases in the Linking Open Data
      initiative.
    </p>
    <p>We have used this API for the Suggestions Service in the scope of generating points from the
       map that are marked as interest points by the user. In this manner, we can query for all the results of a specific
       type (for example museums) having a central point specified by latitude and longitude and a maximum distance 
       of X kilometers (for example 1) as radius. A specific example together with the query result can be seen below:
    </p>

    <img src="linkedQuery.png" alt="request" width="900">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: Example of LinkedGeoData query</figcaption>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
    <img src="linkedResult.png" alt="request" width="900">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: Example of LinkedGeoData result</figcaption>

    <p>The Suggestion Service at the endpoint for getting the suggestions collects all 
      the results and creates a list with all the locations that are a interest point for the user
      together with the place name(in both romanian and english if it is available) based on the 
      start and the destination locations and also taking into consideration the user's preferences 
      and needs (hours, with or without kids).</p>
    <img src="getSuggestions.png" alt="request" width="900">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: Example of getSuggestions result</figcaption>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      <b>Wikidata</b> is used to find items and properties that provide language-independent information about
      entities (real-world things) in applications such as events, places, people, works of art, concepts, etc.
      </p>
    <p>In our case it was used for getting extra details about each of the places that are generated as points of
      interest from the suggestions endpoint. For this, we created a query that searches for places that have values 
      property P625 (coordinates) approximately equals to the latitude and longitude of the given place. It have been
      taken into account an error (for example 0.1) for possible incoherency in the data between LinkedGeoData and Wikidata.
      Also, the language have to be provided in order to get the information in the desired format.</p>
