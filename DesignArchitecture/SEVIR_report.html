    <h2><span>1. </span>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      SEVIR (semantic-based virtual guide) project is a proposal of Web application that will
      allow clients to use the power of the cartographic Web services in order to augment the
      information about one or more points of interest according to user preferences and
      the current context.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="requirements">
    <h2><span>2. </span>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Use well-known cartographic Web service(s), in conjunction to OpenStreetMap and LinkedGeoData,
      in order to augment the information about one or more points (places) of interest according to
      user preferences (e.g., significant routes, businesses, touristic attractions, nearby locations)
      and context: a specific location, date/time, device, current activity, mood, health status,...
      "Smart" suggestions like orientation clues, map annotations, plus external knowledge could be
      provided by DBpedia and/or Wikidata. Take into consideration the use of proper conceptual models
      regarding the map-related information, car GPS integration, user needs (example: a family having
      small children wants a smooth itinerary including many stops versus a group of youngsters focused
      on fun + (pleasant) surprises), internationalization (i.e., support for automated translation)
      and localization, plus the integration with popular social Web applications – supporting actions
      like sharing and/or accessing photos, videos, reviews, advices, etc. All data managed by the
      developed application will be accessed via a SPARQL endpoint. Additionally, various travel-related
      APIs could be used. Bonus: offer also a conversational Web interface – for instance, integrate
      a chatter bot.

      <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 1: Usecase diagram</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The application might be used by a normal user with the fallowing use case scenarios:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Register as a new user of the application.</li>
      <li>Authenticate using a username and a password. This action requires registration.</li>
      <li>View a map with multiple interest points based on the real time location of
        the user. This action requires authentication. </li>
      <li>Add/update the user's preferences. This action requires authentication. </li>
      <li>Set a actual context: mood, health status, etc. This action requires authentication.</li>
      <li>Search for suggested places to visit, orientation clues, possible itinerary to o specific
        destination based on the actual parameters set from context and also on the user's preferences.
        This action requires authentication.</li>
      <li>Share or access photos, videos, reviews, advices on/from social media. This action requires
        authentication. </li>
    </ul>

    </figure>
    <p>
      SEVIR will be implemented as a Angular Web Application that will call 4 principal
      services implemented using Java:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accounts service: it will be used as a the users management system. </li>
      <li>Preferences service: it will be responsible for updating and retrieving the information about
        the user preferences.</li>
      <li>Suggestions service: it will be responsible for generating suggestions based on user
        preferences and context. </li>
      <li>Social-Media service: it will be used for sharing/accessing photos, videos, reviews, advices, etc. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The storage for both the Accounts and Preferences services will be provided by a relational database
      (MySQL) and the operation on it will be done via a SPARQL request.
    </p>
    <p>
      For extra information regarding a place we will also use data from DBpedia and Wikidata.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, there will be used 2 external APIs: OpenStreetMap and LinkedGeoData.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>OpenStreetMap will be used by the Angular application and the Suggestions service in order
        to show the map based on the current location, to show the suggestions routes and places. 
        The suggestions will be generated using information about the users.</li>
      <li>LinkedGeoData will be used by the Suggestions service in order to find in a accurate method
        places to visit, orientation clues, possible itinerary to o specific destination based on the
        actual parameters set from context and also on the user's preferences.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section typeof="sa:APIs" id="apis">
    <h2><span>5. </span>APIs</h2>
    <p>
      For each service there will be implemented different requests based on the needs of implementation:
    </p>

        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 3: APIs specification</figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p>
      As an example, for the suggestions service the GET request will be implemented as fallows:

  <section typeof="sa:ExternalAPIs" id="ExternalAPIs">
    <h2><span>6. </span>External APIs</h2>
    <p>
      <b>OpenStreetMap</b> is a project that creates and distributes free geographic data. OpenStreetMap represents
      physical features on the ground (e.g., roads or buildings) using tags attached to its basic data
      structures (its nodes, ways, and relations). Each tag describes a geographic attribute of the feature
      being shown by that specific node, way or relation.
      OpenStreetMap's free tagging system allows the map to include an unlimited number of attributes describing each
      feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>LinkedGeoData</b> is an effort to add a spatial dimension to the Web of Data / Semantic Web. LinkedGeoData uses
      the information collected by the OpenStreetMap project and makes it available as an RDF knowledge base according
      to the Linked Data principles. It interlinks this data with other knowledge bases in the Linking Open Data
      initiative.
