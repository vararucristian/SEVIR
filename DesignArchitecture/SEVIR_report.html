    <h2><span>1. </span>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      SEVIR (semantic-based virtual guide) project is a proposal of Web application that will
      allow clients to use the power of the cartographic Web services in order to augment the
      information about one or more points of interest according to user preferences and
      the current context.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="requirements">
    <h2><span>2. </span>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Use well-known cartographic Web service(s), in conjunction to OpenStreetMap and LinkedGeoData,
      in order to augment the information about one or more points (places) of interest according to
      user preferences (e.g., significant routes, businesses, touristic attractions, nearby locations)
      and context: a specific location, date/time, device, current activity, mood, health status,...
      "Smart" suggestions like orientation clues, map annotations, plus external knowledge could be
      provided by DBpedia and/or Wikidata. Take into consideration the use of proper conceptual models
      regarding the map-related information, car GPS integration, user needs (example: a family having
      small children wants a smooth itinerary including many stops versus a group of youngsters focused
      on fun + (pleasant) surprises), internationalization (i.e., support for automated translation)
      and localization, plus the integration with popular social Web applications – supporting actions
      like sharing and/or accessing photos, videos, reviews, advices, etc. All data managed by the
      developed application will be accessed via a SPARQL endpoint. Additionally, various travel-related
      APIs could be used. Bonus: offer also a conversational Web interface – for instance, integrate
      a chatter bot.

    <p>
      SEVIR is implemented as a Angular Web Application that will call a principal
      service implemented using Python:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Suggestions service</b>: is responsible for generating suggestions based on user
        preferences and context and for getting the details about each of the suggested places.
        For generating this data it takes into consideration the preferences set by user from frontend.
        This service will be directly called by the Angular application.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       </b>Frontend</b> component is responsible also for getting the user's preferences and for the sharing on social media actions.
       <br> The frontent is implemented using Angular 10 and it has two major component:
       <ul>
         <li>
           The survey component where the user is able to add information about the place trip he wants to simulate like:
           <ol>
            <li>The place where he wants to go</li>
            <li>Things that he is interested about when he is traveling</li>
            <li>The presence of any child</li>
            <li>How much time he have for stops</li>
          </ol> 
         </li>
         <li>The map component where the user will be able to see the generated route for his trip including also the stops and some extra information about the places.</li>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       <li> The application also has support for translating the page content for Romanian and English. This feature is implemented using i18n standards and @ngx-translate.</li>
       <li> The application also supports sharing an image of the map on two social media platforms: Facebook and Pinterest. This was implemented using sharon library.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, there are used 3 external APIs: GoogleMaps, LinkedGeoData and Wikidata.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>GoogleMaps is used by the Angular Application in order
        to show the map based on the current location, to show the suggestions, the routes and the details about the places. </li>
      <li>LinkedGeoData is used by the Suggestions Service in order to find in a accurate method
        places to visit, possible itinerary to o specific destination based on the
        actual parameters set from the application. The calls will come from the Python API.</li>
      <li>Wikidata is used for getting extra information about the suggested places. The calls will be done via the Python API.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section typeof="sa:APIs" id="apis">
    <h2><span>5. </span>APIs</h2>
    <p>
      For each service there will be implemented different requests based on the needs of implementation:
    </p>
      <figure typeOf="sa:image">
        <img src="apis.jpg" alt="APIs" width="900">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 3: APIs specification</figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p>
      As an example, for the suggestions service the GET request will be implemented as follows:
    </p>
      <figure typeOf="sa:image">
        <img src="request.jpg" alt="request" width="900">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: Example of GET request</figcaption>
      </figure>
  </section>
  <section typeof="sa:ExternalAPIs" id="ExternalAPIs">
    <h2><span>6. </span>External APIs</h2>
    <p>
      <b>GoogleMaps</b> will be used for showing the map with: 
      <ul>
        <li>The current location of the user</li>
        <li>The destination point</li>
        <li>The suggested places to visit</li>
      </ul> 
      Each suggestion will be marked on the map and additional information
      will be displayed at click. GoogleMaps will also be used in searching the destination point and for displaying the route 
      between the suggested points. 
      </p>

        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: Example of an open suggestion</figcaption>
    <br>
    <p>
      <b>LinkedGeoData</b> is an effort to add a spatial dimension to the Web of Data / Semantic Web. LinkedGeoData uses
      the information collected by the OpenStreetMap project and makes it available as an RDF knowledge base according
      to the Linked Data principles. It interlinks this data with other knowledge bases in the Linking Open Data
      initiative.
    </p>
    <p>We have used this API for the Suggestions Service in the scope of generating points from the
       map that are marked as interest points by the user. In this manner, we can query for all the results of a specific
       type (for example museums) having a central point specified by latitude and longitude and a maximum distance 
       of X kilometers (for example 1) as radius. A specific example together with the query result can be seen below:
    </p>

    <img src="linkedQuery.png" alt="request" width="900">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: Example of LinkedGeoData query</figcaption>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
    <img src="linkedResult.png" alt="request" width="900">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: Example of LinkedGeoData result</figcaption>

    <p>The Suggestion Service at the endpoint for getting the suggestions collects all 
      the results and creates a list with all the locations that are a interest point for the user
      together with the place name(in both romanian and english if it is available) based on the 
      start and the destination locations and also taking into consideration the user's preferences 
      and needs (hours, with or without kids).</p>
    <img src="getSuggestions.png" alt="request" width="900">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: Example of getSuggestions result</figcaption>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      <b>Wikidata</b> is used to find items and properties that provide language-independent information about
      entities (real-world things) in applications such as events, places, people, works of art, concepts, etc.
      </p>
    <p>In our case it was used for getting extra details about each of the places that are generated as points of
      interest from the suggestions endpoint. For this, we created a query that searches for places that have values 
      for property P625 (coordinates) approximately equals to the latitude and longitude of the given place. It have been
      taken into account an error (for example 0.1 kilometers) for possible incoherency in the data between LinkedGeoData and Wikidata.
      Also, the language have to be provided in order to get the information in the desired format.</p>
    <img src="queryWikidata.png" alt="request" width="900">
      <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: Example of Wikidata query and result</figcaption>
    <p></p>
    <p>The endpoint from Suggestion Service responsible for getting details about a place is getDetails. 
      When calling this endpoint, as input we have to provide the coordinates of the palace in latitude and longitude, an error maximum distance
      and the language desired for getting the results. It generates the following information about that specific place:
      place name, an URL corresponding to the Wikidata resource of the place, and, if exists, a short place description, 
      a image and the address.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <img src="getDetails.png" alt="request" width="900">
      <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig. 4: Example of getDetails result</figcaption>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        For both LinkedGeoData and Wikidata, <b>SPARQL</b> was used as query language and the results were taken
        at the front end level in  <b>JSON</b> format.
